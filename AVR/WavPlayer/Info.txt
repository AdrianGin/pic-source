22kHz 8bit only just works at 8MHz.
Although it was working very good before, the SD card was being streamed so power consumption was high.
The latest change buffers the entire read allowing the SD card to be released.

However double buffering the scheme requires a bit more code and hence, 22kHz only just comes in working at 8MHz

Going to 20MHz, helps two fold, first the Code runs faster, but the SPI transfer speed also runs at a higher speed.
